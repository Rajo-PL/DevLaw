**Generate flowchart. Legend and Step Descriptions (for the Drawing):**

**START**

**BLOCK 200: Stream Initiation (Input Draft)**
The user (Legislator) inputs the text of a new regulation/law into the editor.
The system detects a save attempt ("Save Attempt").

**BLOCK 201: Vectorization and Parsing (NLP Engine)**
The NLP module analyzes the text. It converts sentences (e.g., "Everyone has the right to...") into logical rules (IF entity=citizen THEN grant_right=X).
A "Logical Law Object" is created.

**BLOCK 202: Pattern Retrieval (Reference Load)**
The system retrieves the "Kernel" (Constitution) from a secure registry.
The Kernel contains hard parameters (e.g., MAX_TAX_RATE, NO_CENSORSHIP).

**BLOCK 203: Conflict Simulation (Stress Test / Sandbox)**
The system overlays the Logical Law Object onto the Kernel.
It tests edge cases.
Logical question: Does the new rule overwrite or violate a superior rule?

**BLOCK 204: Decision Node (Validation Gate)**
Decision: Has a critical collision been detected? (YES / NO)

**PATH A (Result: YES - Collision / Unconstitutionality)**

**BLOCK 205a: Kernel Error (Kernel Panic Signal)**
The system throws a critical exception.

**BLOCK 205b: Write Lock**
The database mechanism rejects the write transaction (ROLLBACK).
The law code does not reach the repository. It does not become law.

**END (STOP - REJECTED):**
Display of error report (e.g., "Violation of Art. 30: Dignity").

**PATH B (Result: NO - Compliance)**

**BLOCK 206a: Positive Validation (Integrity OK)**
The system assigns a unique hash (checksum) to the verified text.

**BLOCK 206b: Write Permission (Commit Allow)**
Opening the gate to the repository (GitLawRepo).

**BLOCK 207: Deployment (Merge/Deploy)**
The new law is saved and becomes effective.
